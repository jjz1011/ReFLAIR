# ReFLAIR: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning via Structured Reflection and Reward-Guided Learning

This repository contains the official implementation of **ReFLAIR**, a framework designed to enhance the reflective reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through structured self-reflection and reward-guided optimization.

## Resources

- **Datasets**: The reflection-annotated datasets curated in the paper will be released soon.  
- **Training Code**: Scripts for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reflection quality scorer (RQS), and reinforcement learning optimization will be provided.  
- **Models**: Pretrained checkpoints of ReFLAIR will be made publicly available after camera-ready submission.
